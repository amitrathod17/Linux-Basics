### Container Orchestration

Defination: **“Once an application is built and containerized, the process of managing its deployment, scaling, networking, and overall lifecycle is what we refer to as container orchestration.”**

- different orchestration technologies avialable like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos.
Docker Swarm - lack advance features for application.
Kubernetes - Kubenetes is the most popular of all application but difficult to setup.
Mesos - Difficult to setup but support advance features.
- Kubenetes is available on public clouds ex. azure,gcp,aws
- Kubernetes project is number one project on Github.

Advantages of Container Orchestration:
- The application is highly available and less chance of failure of apllication.
- Multiple instance of application running on different nodes.
- The usera traffic is load balanced across the various containers.
- When demand increase deploy more instance of the applciation.
- The ability to run the service level when its run out of hardware resources, scale the number of underlying nodes up or down without having to take down the application.
- All of this is easily acheivable with a set of declarative object configuration file.

- What is Kubernetes: It is a container orchestration technology used to orchestrate the deployment and management of hundreds and thousand of containers in a clustered envirnoment.

# Container Orchestration

## Overview

Container orchestration is the automated process of managing containerized applications—handling how they are **deployed**, **scaled**, **networked**, monitored, and maintained. Once your application is packaged into containers, orchestration ensures it runs reliably across multiple machines without manual intervention.

## Key Points

* Common orchestration tools include **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, and **Apache Mesos**.
* **Docker Swarm**: Simple but lacks advanced production-grade features.
* **Mesos**: Powerful but complex to set up.
* **Kubernetes**: Most widely used, feature-rich, but has a steeper learning curve.
* Kubernetes is offered across all major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Kubernetes is one of the top open-source projects on GitHub.
* Ensures high availability by running application instances across multiple nodes.
* Automatically distributes user traffic across containers using load balancing.
* Supports scaling—spin up more containers when demand increases.
* Can scale cluster nodes up/down without interrupting the running applications.
* Uses **declarative YAML manifests** to define the desired state of applications.
* Kubernetes enables running and managing hundreds or thousands of containers in clusters.

## Simple Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Scaling During High Traffic

An e-commerce app experiences a traffic spike during a festival sale.
Kubernetes detects high CPU usage on the application Pods and automatically launches more container replicas.
Traffic is load balanced across them, preventing any downtime.

### Scenario 2: Node Failure Recovery

A Kubernetes node unexpectedly shuts down due to hardware failure.
Kubernetes immediately reschedules the affected Pods onto healthy nodes.
Users do not notice any interruption since replicas were already running elsewhere.

## Footnotes

* Kubernetes Architecture
* Control Plane vs Worker Nodes
* Deployments & ReplicaSets
* Autoscaling (HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler)
* Service Networking & Load Balancers
