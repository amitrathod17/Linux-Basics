## What are Containers
- Kubernetes is also know as k8.
- Kubernetes is build by Google.
- Kubernetes is a open-source project.

To understand k8 first understand containers and orchestration.

- Containers are completely isolated envionments.
- Containers share the same operating system kernel.
- Docker containers utilizes LXC
- The main purpose of DOcker is to containerize  applications and to ship and run them.
- Docker containers are light weight.
- Virtual machine consume higher disk space
- Docker containers boot faster.
- An Image is a package or a template.
- Containers are running instances of image that are isolated and have their own environments and set of processes.

# What Are Containers

## Overview

Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application with everything it needs to run. They share the host’s operating system kernel but keep their own processes, filesystem, and runtime environment. Tools like Docker make it easy to build, ship, and run these containerized applications.

## Key Points

* Containers are **isolated environments** for running applications.
* They **share the host OS kernel**, unlike virtual machines which run a full OS.
* Docker originally used **LXC**; now it uses its own container runtime components.
* Docker’s main purpose is to **package (containerize), ship, and run** applications easily.
* Containers are **lightweight** compared to VMs.
* **Virtual machines consume more disk space** and include a full OS.
* **Containers boot faster** because they reuse the host kernel.
* An **image** is a package/template containing application code + dependencies.
* A **container** is a running instance of an image with its own processes.

## Simple Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Running a Web App

You containerize a small Node.js application.
You build an image using a Dockerfile and run it as a container.
The app runs in isolation with its own dependencies, without affecting the host system.

### Scenario 2 — Comparing VM vs Container Startup

You deploy a microservice.

* Starting a VM takes ~30 seconds or more.
* Starting a container takes ~1–2 seconds.
  This speed difference makes containers ideal for scaling apps quickly in Kubernetes.

## Footnotes

* Docker architecture
* Container runtimes (containerd, CRI-O)
* Virtual machines vs containers
* Kubernetes orchestration
