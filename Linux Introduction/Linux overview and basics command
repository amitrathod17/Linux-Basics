- Legacy: Very old, unsupported software, often used for historical reasons.

<b>H. Connectivity and Remote Access</b>
- SSH (Secure Shell): Understand SSH as a protocol for secure remote access to Linux servers.
- SSH Client (e.g., PuTTY): Recognize the need for an SSH client to connect to remote servers.
Key-based Authentication: Understand the use of private keys (PPK files) for secure authentication.

Port 22: Recognize port 22 as the default port for SSH.
- Fingerprint: Understand the concept of an SSH fingerprint for verifying server identity.
- Verbose Mode (-v flag): Understand the purpose of verbose mode for detailed output during connection

<b>I. ASCI and Encoding</b>

- ASCII Text: Understand ASCII as a character encoding standard.
- Text vs. Binary: Differentiate between ASCII text files and other file types (e.g., executable binaries).
- Encoding: Recognize the concept of different character encodings beyond ASCII (e.g., UTF-8, Arabic, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese).

III. Quiz Answer Key

Explain the primary difference between a Linux operating system you build yourself and one that is POSIX compliant?

    A self-built Linux system may not adhere to the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standards. POSIX compliance ensures that the operating system behaves predictably across different systems, making software more portable and interoperable. Non-POSIX compliant systems lack this standardized behavior, potentially limiting software compatibility.

What is the role of kernel.org in the GNU/Linux ecosystem, and how does it relate to the applications provided by GNU? 

    kernel.org is the official website for the Linux kernel, providing its source code and development. In the GNU/Linux ecosystem, operating systems are created by combining the Linux kernel from kernel.org with applications primarily sourced from the GNU Project. The kernel acts as the core, while GNU provides essential utilities and software.

Define a "virtual server instance" in the context of cloud computing, and list the four core components that constitute its resources. A virtual server instance is a virtualized computing environment, such as an EC2 instance, that mimics a physical server but runs on a shared hardware infrastructure in a data centre. Its core resources are CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, and Network, which are allocated virtually to the instance.

Why do administrators and engineers often prefer working with the Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Linux?

    Administrators and engineers prefer the CLI for its speed, efficiency, and automation capabilities. CLI commands are much faster to execute for repetitive tasks and can be easily scripted, which is vital for managing large-scale server environments where precision and automation are paramount. GUIs, while user-friendly, can be slower and less precise for complex administrative operations.

Distinguish between the apt update and apt upgrade commands in Linux. What does each command specifically accomplish? 

    apt update refreshes the list of available packages and their versions from the repositories, essentially updating the package index. It does not install or upgrade any software. apt upgrade, on the other hand, installs newer versions of all currently installed packages that have updates available, based on the information fetched by apt update.

What is an "inode" in the Linux file system, and why is it significant for managing files and directories? 

    An inode (index node) is a data structure in a Linux file system that stores metadata about a file or directory, such as its permissions, ownership, timestamps, and physical disk block locations. It is significant because it provides a unique identifier for each file system object and is crucial for the kernel to locate and manage files, regardless of their name or path.

Describe the purpose of Long Term Support (LTS) releases for Linux distributions in a production environment? 

    Long Term Support (LTS) releases provide extended maintenance and support (typically 5 years) compared to standard releases. Their purpose in production environments is to offer a stable, predictable, and secure platform for critical systems, minimizing the need for frequent major upgrades and reducing operational risks.

When connecting to a remote Linux server via SSH, what is the significance of the "fingerprint" that might be displayed upon the first connection? 

    The SSH fingerprint is a unique cryptographic hash that identifies the remote server. Its significance lies in providing a way to verify the authenticity of the server and prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks. Upon the first connection, the client asks to accept this fingerprint to ensure future connections are to the same, trusted server.

Explain the Linux philosophy that "everything is just a file." Provide an example from the audio to illustrate this concept? 

    The Linux philosophy "everything is just a file" means that traditional files, directories, and even hardware devices (like /dev/sda) are treated as files within the file system hierarchy, accessible through standard file operations. An example from the audio is when the speaker states that even a directory, though it appears as a folder, is fundamentally considered a file in Linux.

What is the sudo command used for, and why is it crucial for administrative tasks in Linux? 

    The sudo (superuser do) command allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser (root) or another user. It is crucial for administrative tasks in Linux because it enables users to perform privileged operations (like installing software or modifying system files) without needing to log in as root directly, thereby enhancing security by limiting root access.
